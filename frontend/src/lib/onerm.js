// rep count, and only reps-mode sets carry both. Cardio sets ({min, speed}) and timed sets
// ({sec, w}) therefore drop out of every scan here on their own — there is no exercise-type
// check to keep in sync.
//
// Formulas are the usual submaximal-load estimators. Epley is the default because it is the
// one most lifters have seen; all of them agree closely at low reps and diverge as reps rise,
// which is exactly why REP_CAP exists.

// The formulas and the single-set estimate live with the engine
// (api/engine/one-rm.js), so the API's profile migration uses the same numbers.
