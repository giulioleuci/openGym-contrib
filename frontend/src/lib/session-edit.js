// Editing a workout that is already in history (#143): its exercises, sets and notes.
//
// The editor is the ordinary workout screen working on a draft in `state.active` (the store keeps
// it as A; `editingWorkoutId` says whose), so a reload, a closed tab or an offline spell keeps the
// draft, and the saved record stays exactly as it was until Save. When the session happened — its
// day, start and length — is not edited here: WorkoutDetail has its own rows for that
// (lib/workout-date.js).
//
// The draft is the saved exposures read back into the rows the workout screen edits
// (rowsOfPerformance), and Save writes them the way a live finish does (buildCompletedSession):
// the same rows, summary and audit, against the prescription the session was built from.
//
// Save replaces the record by id. Getting that replacement onto every device is the sync's job,
// not this file's: the record is stamped with the time of the edit (stampWorkout), and a conflict
// between two copies keeps the version edited last (lib/sync-merge.js). So the edit replaces the
// old copy wherever it is, is never joined by it as a duplicate, and an older copy cannot come
// back over it on a 409.
